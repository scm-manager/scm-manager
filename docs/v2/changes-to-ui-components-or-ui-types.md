# Changes to `ui-components`/`ui-types` 

## Dev
If you want (or need) to add components to the `ui-components`-Packages (or types to the `ui-types`-Package) and use them in `scm-ui`; you have to link the packages using yarn link (since your changes will not have been pushed to npm.js). To do so, cd to the `scm-ui` directory and type

```yarn link @scm-manager/ui-components```
resp.
```yarn linl @scm-manager/ui-types```.

## Releasing changes to npm.js
**TODO**
