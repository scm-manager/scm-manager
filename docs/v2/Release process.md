```
git checkout master && git pull && git merge develop --ff-only && git push origin master
```

## Create and push tag

```
git tag -s -a <version> -m "<version>"
git push --tags origin
```

```
git checkout develop
```

Edit `pom.xml`: `version` has to be set to the new development version, `tag` to `HEAD`.

Edit `package.json`: `version` has to be set to the new development version.

```
git commit -am "Prepare for next development iteration"
git push origin develop
```
