## Quickstart

Grab the latest version from [download page](/download) and replace `<version>` in the code blocks below

```bash
docker run --name scm -p 8080:8080 -v scm-home:/var/lib/scm scmmanager/scm-manager:<version>
```

for example:

```bash
docker run --name scm -p 8080:8080 -v scm-home:/var/lib/scm scmmanager/scm-manager:2.0.0
```

## Persistence

It is recommended to create a persistent volume for the scm-manager home directory.
This allows scm-manager updates and recreation of the container without lose of data.
The home directory is located at `/var/lib/scm`.
It is recommended to use a volume managed by docker. 
If it is required to use a host directory, keep in mind that the scm-manager process is executed with a user which has the id 1000.
So ensure that the user with the uid 1000 can write to the directory e.g.:

```text
mkdir /scm_home
chown 1000:1000 /scm_home
docker run --name scm -p 8080:8080 -v /scm_home:/var/lib/scm scmmanager/scm-manager:<version>
```

## Exposed Ports

SCM-Manager exposes its http port on port 8080.
If you want to use the ssh plugin, keep in mind that this plugin requires an extra port (default is 2222).

```text
docker run --name scm -p 2222:2222 -p 8080:8080 -v scm-home:/var/lib/scm scmmanager/scm-manager:<version>
```

## JVM Parameters

If it becomes necessary to add JVM parameters to the start, there are two ways to do this:

* As arguments e.g.:

```bash
docker run scmmanager/scm-manager:<version> -Dsome.property=value
```

* Or as JAVA_OPTS environment variable e.g.:

```bash
docker run -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dsome.property=value" scmmanager/scm-manager:<version>

```

## Docker Compose

If you want to use the image with docker-compose have a look at the example below. 

```yaml
version: '2.0'
services:
  scm:
    image: scmmanager/scm-manager:<version>
    ports:
    - "8080:8080"
    # if the ssh plugin is used
    - "2222:2222"
    volumes:
    - scmhome:/var/lib/scm
volumes:
  scmhome: {}
```

## Variants

We are offer two variants of the SCM-Manager docker image one with OpenJDK on Alpine and the other with Eclipse Temurin on Debian.

### scmmanager/scm-manager:<version>-alpine

This image uses the Alpine operating system and the OpenJDK distribution from the official apk repository.
The image is available for the following os/architectures:

* linux/amd64
* linux/arm64

### scmmanager/scm-manager:<version>-debian

This image uses the Debian operating system and the Eclipse Temurin JDK.
The image is available for the following os/architectures:

* linux/amd64
* linux/arm64
* linux/arm/v7

### scmmanager/scm-manager:<version>

The default image is mainly an alias for the alpine variant, but there is no alpine variant for arm/v7. 
For arm/v7 the debian variant is used.

* linux/amd64 uses the alpine variant
* linux/arm64 uses the alpine variant
* linux/arm/v7 uses the debian variant
