If you don't have EcoSystem installed yet, 
the [quickstart](https://cloudogu.com/en/ecosystem/quick-start-guide/) is the fastest way to get started.

## Setup

If you are about to install a fresh EcoSystem, you can simply select SCM-Manager in the [Dogu selection](https://cloudogu.com/en/ecosystem/quick-start-guide/#dogu-choose-your-dogus). 
The setup will then install the latest available version of the Dogus.

## Manual Installation

If you already have a running installation without SCM-Manager, you can simply run the following command to install the latest version of the Dogu:

```bash
cesapp install official/scm
```
