### General
In the general settings the display name, e-mail address, external flag and active status of an account can be edited. 

If a user is converted from internal to external the password is going to be removed. When switching an external user to an internal one, a password must be set using the password modal dialogue.

On the bottom is also a button to delete the user. The deletion is irreversible.

### Password
The password of a user can be changed in the password section. Users can also change their password themselves by clicking on the "Change password" link in the footer of SCM-Manager, under their username. That will take them to their settings where they can change their password, amongst others.
