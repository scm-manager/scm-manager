In the plugins section, plugins for SCM-Manager can be managed with the help of the external plugin center. Plugins are distinguished between installed and available plugins. They are grouped based on their main functionality like for example workflow or authentication.

Plugins can be managed by action icons on the tiles. System relevant plugins that come with SCM-Manager by default cannot be uninstalled or updated.

In order for changes to plugins to become effective, the SCM-Manager server needs to be restarted. That can be done after every single action. It is also possible to queue several actions like the installation of a new plugin, updates or the deletion of a plugin and to perform all actions with one restart. If an action (installation, uninstallation, update) for a plugin was performed, the buttons "Execute changes" and "Abort changes"  appear. If you choose to execute  the changes, a popup window that shows the current queue (all actions without a restart) appears. Now the user can decide whether to execute the changes by restarting the server. If there are actions in the queue that are no longer desired, the queue can be emptied with the abort changes button.
