The SCM-Manager enhances keyboard interaction and navigation through additional shortcuts.

### Summary

While using the SCM-Manager, a summary of all shortcuts available to the active user on the current page can be opened
from anywhere by pressing the `?` key.

### Global Shortcuts

| Key Combination | Description                |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| ?               | Open the shortcut summary  |
| /               | Focus global quick search  |
| alt r           | Navigate to Repositories   |
| alt u           | Navigate to Users          |
| alt g           | Navigate to Groups         |
| alt a           | Navigate to Administration |

### List Navigation

Some pages with lists on them support keyboard navigation.
If the page supports this feature, the shortcuts show up in the shortcut overview dialog (`?`).

| Key Combination | Description              |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| j               | Focus next list item     |
| k               | Focus previous list item |

### Repository-specific Shortcuts

| Key Combination | Description               |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| g i             | Switch to repository info |
| g b             | Switch to branches        |
| g t             | Switch to tags            |
| g c             | Switch to code            |
| g s             | Switch to settings        |

### Plugin Shortcuts

Plugins can introduce new shortcuts.
They may be global, repository-specific or connected to an entirely different context.
They will automatically be included in the summary generated within the SCM-Manager.
To find the shortcuts outside the SCM-Manager, please refer to the documentation of the plugin.
