### Plugin Shortcuts

Plugins can introduce new shortcuts.
They may be global, repository-specific or connected to an entirely different context.
They will automatically be included in the summary generated within the SCM-Manager.
To find the shortcuts outside the SCM-Manager, please refer to the documentation of the plugin.
