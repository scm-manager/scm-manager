/**
 * This class is a simple implementation of the {@link WorkingCopyPool} to demonstrate,
 * how caching can work in the simplest way. For the first time a {@link WorkingCopy} is
 * requested for a repository with {@link #getWorkingCopy(SimpleWorkingCopyFactory.WorkingCopyContext)},
 * this implementation fetches a new directory from the {@link WorkdirProvider}.
 * On {@link #contextClosed(SimpleWorkingCopyFactory.WorkingCopyContext, File)},
 * the directory is not deleted, but put into a map with the repository id as key.
 * When a working copy is requested with {@link #getWorkingCopy(SimpleWorkingCopyFactory.WorkingCopyContext)}
 * for a repository with such an existing directory, it is taken from the map, reclaimed and
 * returned as {@link WorkingCopy}.
 * If for one repository a working copy is requested, while another is in use already,
 * a second directory is requested from the {@link WorkdirProvider} for the second one.
 * If a context is closed with {@link #contextClosed(SimpleWorkingCopyFactory.WorkingCopyContext, File)}
 * and there already is a directory stored in the map for the repository,
 * the directory from the closed context simply is deleted.
 * <br>
 * In general, this implementation should speed up things a bit, but one has to take into
 * account, that there is no monitoring of diskspace. So you have to make sure, that
 * there is enough space for a clone of each repository in the working dir.
 * <br>
 * Possible enhancements:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Monitoring of times</li>
 *   <li>Allow multiple cached directories for busy repositories (possibly taking initial branches into account)</li>
 *   <li>Measure allocated disk space and set a limit</li>
 *   <li>Remove directories not used for a longer time</li>
 *   <li>Wait for a cached directory on parallel requests</li>
 * </ul>
