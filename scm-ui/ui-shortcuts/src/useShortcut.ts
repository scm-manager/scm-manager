/**
 * ## Summary
 *
 * Binds a global keyboard shortcut to a given callback.
 *
 * The callback is automatically cleaned up upon unmount.
 *
 * ## Supported keys
 *
 * For modifier keys you can use shift, ctrl, alt, or meta.
 *
 * You can substitute option for alt and command for meta.
 *
 * Other special keys are backspace, tab, enter, return, capslock, esc, escape, space, pageup, pagedown, end, home, left, up, right, down, ins, del, and plus.
 *
 * Any other key you should be able to reference by name like a, /, $, *, or =.
 *
 * A "mod" helper exists which maps to either "command" on Mac and "ctrl" on Windows and Linux.
 *
 * ## Combinations
 *
 * Keys can be combined by separating them with a whitespace.
 * For using modifiers, prefix the key with the modifier and concat them with a "+".
 *
 * Please also refer to the examples.
 *
 * @param key The keycode combination that triggers the callback
 * @param callback The function that is executed when the key combination is pressed, returning `true` additionally executes default browser behaviour
 * @param options Whether the shortcut is currently active, defaults to true
 * @example useShortcut("a b", ...)
 * @example useShortcut("ctrl+shift+k", ...)
 * @see https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap
 * @see https://craig.is/killing/mice
