In confirmation dialogs, there are two actions.<br/>
One to cancel the current process and one to confirm it.<br/>
Aborting is always the secondary action, confirmation always the primary.
Focus is always on the cancelling action.

<Story name="Confirmation Dialog">

    <p>Do you really want to delete this user ?</p>
