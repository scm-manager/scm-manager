# Buttons

The `@scm-manager/ui-buttons` library provides [atoms](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#atoms) implemented
as minimal wrappers around native html elements styled to match the general SCM-Manager aesthetic.

## Components

There are three actionable components available. Styling is consistent amongst them and all have the required `variant` property.

1. [Button](?path=/story/components--button)
2. [Link Button](?path=/story/components--link-button)
3. [External Link Button](?path=/story/components--external-link-button)

## Usage

Actionable components serve a dedicated purpose. It is therefore important to know when and how to use them.

### Variants

There are four variants available to each of the three button types, varying in importance.

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Emphasis</th>
    <th>Button Variant</th>
    <th>Usage Examples</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Very High</td>
    <td><Button variant="signal" className="w-full">Signal</Button></td>
    <td>Destructive actions</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>High</td>
    <td><Button variant="primary" className="w-full">Primary</Button></td>
    <td>Form submit</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Normal</td>
    <td><Button variant="secondary" className="w-full">Secondary</Button></td>
    <td>Confirm action in dialog</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Low</td>
    <td><Button variant="tertiary" className="w-full">Tertiary</Button></td>
    <td>Circumstantially relevant action on page with many actionable elements</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Content

Buttons exclusively contain text and no icons. Icons tend to be ambiguous and not always applicable which leads to inconsistent
and cluttered layouts.

Button text should be short, concise and describe the action performed.
