 *                     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 *                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
 *
 *  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 *  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 *  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 *
 *                             Preamble
 *
 *   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 * software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 * cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
 *
 *   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 * to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 * our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 * share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 * software for all its users.
 *
 *   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 * price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 * have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 * them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 * want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 * free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 *
 *   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
 * with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
 * you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
 * and/or modify the software.
 *
 *   A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
 * improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
 * receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
 * incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
 * encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
 * software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
 * The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
 * letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
 * source code to the public.
 *
 *   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
 * ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
 * to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
 * provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
 * users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
 * a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
 * code of the modified version.
 *
 *   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
 * published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
 * a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
 * released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
 * this license.
 *
 *   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 * modification follow.
 *
 *                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *   0. Definitions.
 *
 *   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
 *
 *   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 * works, such as semiconductor masks.
 *
 *   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 * License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
 * "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
 *
 *   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 * in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 * exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 * earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
 *
 *   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 * on the Program.
 *
 *   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 * permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 * infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 * computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
 * distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 * public, and in some countries other activities as well.
 *
 *   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 * parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 * a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
 *
 *   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
 * to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 * feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 * tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
 * extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
 * work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
 * the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 * menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
 *
 *   1. Source Code.
 *
 *   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 * for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
 * form of a work.
 *
 *   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 * standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 * interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 * is widely used among developers working in that language.
 *
 *   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 * than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 * packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 * Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 * Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 * implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 * "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 * (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 * (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 * produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
 *
 *   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 * the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 * work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 * control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 * System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 * programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 * which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 * includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 * the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 * linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 * such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 * subprograms and other parts of the work.
 *
 *   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
 * can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
 * Source.
 *
 *   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
 * same work.
 *
 *   2. Basic Permissions.
 *
 *   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 * copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 * conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 * permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 * covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 * content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
 * rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
 *
 *   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
 * convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
 * in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
 * of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
 * with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
 * the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
 * not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
 * for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
 * and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 * your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
 *
 *   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
 * the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
 * makes it unnecessary.
 *
 *   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
 *
 *   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 * measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 * 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 * similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 * measures.
 *
 *   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 * circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
 * is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
 * the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
 * modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
 * users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
 * technological measures.
 *
 *   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
 *
 *   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 * receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 * appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 * keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 * non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 * keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 * recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
 *
 *   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
 * and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
 *
 *   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
 *
 *   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 * produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 * terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 *
 *     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
 *     it, and giving a relevant date.
 *
 *     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
 *     released under this License and any conditions added under section
 *     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
 *     "keep intact all notices".
 *
 *     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
 *     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
 *     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
 *     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
 *     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
 *     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
 *     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
 *
 *     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
 *     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
 *     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
 *     work need not make them do so.
 *
 *   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
 * works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
 * and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
 * in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
 * "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
 * used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
 * beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
 * in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
 * parts of the aggregate.
 *
 *   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
 *
 *   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
 * of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 * machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
 * in one of these ways:
 *
 *     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
 *     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
 *     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
 *     customarily used for software interchange.
 *
 *     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
 *     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
 *     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
 *     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
 *     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
 *     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
 *     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
 *     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
 *     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
 *     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
 *     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
 *
 *     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
 *     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
 *     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
 *     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
 *     with subsection 6b.
 *
 *     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
 *     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
 *     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
 *     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
 *     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
 *     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
 *     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
 *     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
 *     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
 *     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
 *     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
 *     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 *
 *     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
 *     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
 *     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
 *     charge under subsection 6d.
 *
 *   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
 * from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
 * included in conveying the object code work.
 *
 *   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
 * tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
 * or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
 * into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
 * doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
 * product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
 * typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
 * of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
 * actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
 * is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
 * commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
 * the only significant mode of use of the product.
 *
 *   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
 * procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
 * and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
 * a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
 * suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
 * code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
 * modification has been made.
 *
 *   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
 * specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
 * part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
 * User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
 * fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
 * Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
 * by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
 * if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
 * modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
 * been installed in ROM).
 *
 *   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
 * requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
 * for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
 * the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
 * network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
 * adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
 * protocols for communication across the network.
 *
 *   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
 * in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
 * documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
 * source code form), and must require no special password or key for
 * unpacking, reading or copying.
 *
 *   7. Additional Terms.
 *
 *   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 * License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 * Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 * be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
 * that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
 * apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
 * under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
 * this License without regard to the additional permissions.
 *
 *   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
 * remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
 * it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
 * removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
 * additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
 * for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
 *
 *   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
 * add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
 * that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
 *
 *     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
 *     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
 *
 *     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
 *     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
 *     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
 *
 *     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
 *     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
 *     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
 *
 *     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
 *     authors of the material; or
 *
 *     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
 *     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
 *
 *     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
 *     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
 *     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
 *     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
 *     those licensors and authors.
 *
 *   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
 * restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
 * received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
 * governed by this License along with a term that is a further
 * restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
 * a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
 * License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
 * of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
 * not survive such relicensing or conveying.
 *
 *   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
 * must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
 * additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
 * where to find the applicable terms.
 *
 *   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
 * form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
 * the above requirements apply either way.
 *
 *   8. Termination.
 *
 *   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 * provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 * modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 * this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
 * paragraph of section 11).
 *
 *   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
 * license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
 * provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
 * finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
 * holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
 * prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 *
 *   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 * reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
 * violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
 * received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
 * copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
 * your receipt of the notice.
 *
 *   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 * licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 * this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 * reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
 * material under section 10.
 *
 *   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
 *
 *   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 * run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
 * occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
 * to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
 * nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
 * modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
 * not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
 * covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
 *
 *   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
 *
 *   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 * receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 * propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
 * for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
 *
 *   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
 * organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
 * organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
 * work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
 * transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
 * licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
 * give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
 * Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
 * the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
 *
 *   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
 * rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
 * not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
 * rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
 * (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 * any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
 * sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
 *
 *   11. Patents.
 *
 *   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
 * License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
 * work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
 *
 *   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
 * owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
 * hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
 * by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
 * but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
 * consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
 * purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
 * patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
 * this License.
 *
 *   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 * patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
 * make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
 * propagate the contents of its contributor version.
 *
 *   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
 * agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
 * (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
 * sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
 * party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
 * patent against the party.
 *
 *   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
 * and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
 * to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
 * publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
 * then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
 * available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
 * patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
 * consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
 * license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
 * actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
 * covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
 * in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
 * country that you have reason to believe are valid.
 *
 *   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
 * arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
 * covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
 * receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
 * or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
 * you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
 * work and works based on it.
 *
 *   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
 * the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
 * conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
 * specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
 * work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
 * in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
 * to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
 * the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
 * parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
 * patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
 * conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
 * for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
 * contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
 * or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
 *
 *   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
 * any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
 * otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
 *
 *   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
 *
 *   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 * excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
 * covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 * License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
 * not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
 * to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
 * the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
 * License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
 *
 *   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
 *
 *   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
 * Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
 * interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
 * supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
 * Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
 * from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
 * means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
 * shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
 * of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
 * following paragraph.
 *
 *   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
 * permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
 * under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
 * combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
 * License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
 * but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
 * 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 *
 *   14. Revised Versions of this License.
 *
 *   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 * the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
 * will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 * address new problems or concerns.
 *
 *   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
 * Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
 * Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
 * option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
 * version or of any later version published by the Free Software
 * Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
 * GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
 * by the Free Software Foundation.
 *
 *   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
 * versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
 * public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
 * to choose that version for the Program.
 *
 *   Later license versions may give you additional or different
 * permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
 * author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
 * later version.
 *
 *   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
 *
 *   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 * APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
 * HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
 * OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 * THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 * PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
 * IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
 * ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 *
 *   16. Limitation of Liability.
 *
 *   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 * WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
 * THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 * GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
 * USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF

 *             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 *
 *   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 * possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 * free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 *
 *   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 * to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 * state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 * the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 *
 *     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 *     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 *
 *     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
 *     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published
 *     by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
 *     (at your option) any later version.
 *
 *     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 *     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 *     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 *     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
 *
 *     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
 *     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 *
 * Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 *
 *   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
 * network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
 * get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
 * interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
 * of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
 * solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
 * specific requirements.
 *
 *   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
 * if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
 * For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see
 * <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
